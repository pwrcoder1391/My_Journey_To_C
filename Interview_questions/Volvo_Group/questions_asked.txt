Q1. Write a C code for pallindrome 

    Solution - 

        1. take the int 
        2. Reverse the int 
        3. compare both the input and reversed value


        Reversing the int 

        - need a multiplier for units and tens and so on ... eg for 3 digit number = 1000
        - need a counter 
        ^ both can be done in same loop

        in another loop using the ^ counter - 
        - divide the units * multiplier + the value = the value 
        - divide the multiplier by 10 (reduce the thousands/tens)

Q2. Make a multilevel class for library management system 

    - Class book 
    - Class student 
    - student has public book
